# Welcome to My 42 Projects

Welcome to my GitHub profile! This repository showcases the various projects I have worked on as part of my journey at [42](https://www.42lehavre.fr/), an innovative coding school that focuses on peer-to-peer learning and real-world problem-solving.

In this repository, you'll find a selection of projects from my 42 curriculum, demonstrating my skills in C programming, algorithms, system design, and more. Each project reflects the challenges, solutions, and personal growth I've experienced throughout the program.

## Projects

### 1. [**CPP**](https://github.com/gkubina/42-common_core/tree/main/CPP)
This project introduced me to C++ and object-oriented programming (OOP). I learned about classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and the Standard Template Library (STL). The project was focused on applying OOP principles to solve real-world problems.

### 2. [**Philosophers**](https://github.com/gkubina/42-common_core/tree/main/Philosophers)
The "Philosophers" project is a classic synchronization problem that involves simulating philosophers sitting at a table, eating spaghetti. I applied multithreading and mutexes to avoid race conditions and deadlock, practicing my skills in concurrency and thread management.

### 3. [**cub_3D**](https://github.com/gkubina/42-common_core/tree/main/cub_3D)
In this project, we created with Daleliev a basic 3D engine based on the raycasting technique, which allowed us to render a 3D world from a 2D map. We
worked with handling textures, creating a simple graphical environment, and mastering the low-level aspects of graphics programming.

### 4. [**fract-ol**](https://github.com/gkubina/42-common_core/tree/main/fract-ol)
In "fract-ol", I implemented fractal generators, focusing on the Mandelbrot and Julia sets. The project helped me learn about graphical rendering, mathematical algorithms, and how to manipulate pixel data for visual effects.

### 5. [**ft_printf**](https://github.com/gkubina/42-common_core/tree/main/ft_printf)
This project required me to implement a simplified version of the `printf` function. It helped me gain a deeper understanding of variadic functions, format specifiers, and memory handling in C, while also enhancing my knowledge of string formatting.

### 6. [**minishell**](https://github.com/gkubina/42-common_core/tree/main/minishell)
In the "minishell" project, we built with Daleliev a basic shell that could execute commands, manage processes, and handle piping and redirection. This project was a deep dive into system programming, process control, and handling input/output streams.

### 7. [**minitalk**](https://github.com/gkubina/42-common_core/tree/main/minitalk)
"minitalk" is a project where I implemented a communication system using UNIX signals. This allowed me to transfer data between two processes, demonstrating my understanding of signals, process communication, and signal handling in a Unix environment.

### 8. [**push-swap**](https://github.com/gkubina/42-common_core/tree/main/push-swap)
In "push-swap", I implemented a sorting algorithm to efficiently sort a stack of integers using a minimal number of operations. This project focused on algorithm optimization and problem-solving with constraints on space and time complexity.

## Skills Learned

Through these projects, I have gained experience in:

- **C/C++ Programming**: Strong foundation in both C and C++ programming languages, focusing on memory management, object-oriented principles, and system-level programming.
- **Algorithms & Data Structures**: Expertise in sorting algorithms, stack management, multithreading, and inter-process communication.
- **Graphics Programming**: Experience in 3D rendering techniques such as raycasting and fractal generation.
- **Unix/Linux Systems**: Deep knowledge of UNIX signals, process management, and system-level interactions.
- **Version Control**: Proficiency in Git for collaborative development and version tracking.

## About Me

I am currently a student at 42 Le Havre, passionate about programming and continuous learning. I enjoy solving complex problems and tackling challenges through code. I'm always looking to expand my knowledge and improve my skills by working on diverse projects.
